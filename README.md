## Description

As an engineer I need to tune my laptop to have its best performance.

## The laptop

is... pretty old. It's at least 7 years old. 
Its memory capacity is 8GB. How about its cpu? 
It's a `Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4210U CPU @ 1.70GHz` (2 coes x 2 threads)?
This is just enough for daiyl web surfing...
until it isn't.

## Firefox
